# Swipe back to the Clock

Let's you swipe from left to right on any app to return back to the clock face.

## Configurable Modes:

The swipe modes can be configured in the settings app, under "Swipe to Clock".

- Always Off: Deactivated for all apps (Default)
- White List: Only activate for chosen apps, otherwise deactivated for all apps.
- Black List: Only disabled for chosen apps, otherwise activated for all apps.
- Always On: Active for all apps (Not actually recommended! E.g. Games need to be able to deal with swipe gestures)

## Motivation:

The goal is to further support touch-only usage of the BangleJS 2 watch. You can use the [Swiper Clock Launch](https://banglejs.com/apps/#swiper%20clock%20launch) or the [Pattern Launcher](https://banglejs.com/apps/#pattern%20launcher) to further enable touch-only support of the watch.
