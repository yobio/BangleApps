# Theme Setter #

This little tool allows you to configure the global theme of all Bangle.js apps
(provided that they do not override global settings) in a more comfortable way
than through the settings menu.

This app also acts as an example for a non-trivial Bangle.js application
using the "layout" library, custom controls and generic event dispatching.
