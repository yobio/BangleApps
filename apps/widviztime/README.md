# Widget Autohide Widget
This widget is forked from the "Widget Visibility Widget" 
It should make widgets completely hidden (except for 4 seconds after the watch is unlocked)

Additional features that I want to implement: 
- Only show widgets when in app launcher
- Make timeout adjustable
- Disable widgets completely
